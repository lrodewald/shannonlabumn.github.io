### Dr. Cari Schmitz Carley

Dr. Cari Schmitz Carley worked on automated image analysis and breeding and evaluating new potato cultivars. She has recently moved on to Aardevo to breed diploid potatoes.

### Colin Jones

Colin was a graduate student working on a M.S. in Applied Plant Sciences with a minor in Sustainable Agricultural Systems. His thesis work studies nitrogen use efficiency in potato. Colin will be moving on to study natural strands of hemp as a researcher in the Michaels Lab.

## Previous Undergraduates

### Nhung Pham

Nhung was in the our lab in the Spring of 2019 and was working toward obtaining a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics.  While in the lab, she worked on a diploid GWAS experiment and did some greenhouse work.

### Nansea Ji

Nansea was in the lab in the Spring of 2019 and worked on a diploid potato GWAS experiment. She majors in Biology and plans on going to medical school in the future.

### Akpevwe Ikoba

Akpevwe worked with is in the summer of 2018.  She tested infertility between potato cultivars and a wild species we use for breeding, data manipulation, and some greenhouse work.  We were recently notified that she will be attending the University of Colorado to study cardiovascular aging.

### Jessi Huege

Jessi was around at the very beginning until Summer of 2018.  She spent her time in the lab experimenting with methods for clonal propagation and maintenance of wild potato relatives and took the lead on botanical phenotyping of late stage potato cultivars for plant variety protection applications.  We were recently notified that she had started her own freelance gardening business.
