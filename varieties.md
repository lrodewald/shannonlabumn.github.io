### Polaris Gold
The Shannon Lab is excited to announce our first variety release! Polaris Gold is a potato with bright yellow flesh and wide-ranging culinary potential. This variety has been described as "aromatic," "nutty," "sweet," and "buttery." It makes great chips, mashed potatoes, and home fries, and is perfect for the Minnesota favorite, lefse.
