##Dr. Laura Shannon

Dr. Shannon is an assistant professor of potato breeding, genetics, and genomics in the Department of Horticultural Science at the University of Minnesota.  She is a population and quantitative geneticist by training and she applies that experience to elucidate potato diversity and the complex nature of autotetraploid genomics as well as developing new potato varieties for Minnesota growers.  She earned an undergraduate degree in biology and anthropology at Grinnell College and a PhD in genetics from the University of Wisconsin. Her post doctoral research was done in the department of Biomedical Sciences at Cornell and the Department of Horticulture at the University of Wisconsin. She enjoys overly complicated board games, bird watching, and exploring the theater, fashion, and breweries of her new home in the Twin Cities. For a list of Dr. Shannon's publications, click here.

##Dr. Thomas Stefaniak

Dr. Stefaniak is a Researcher 5, Breeding Specialist in the Department of Horticulture. He is a plant breeder by training focusing on the development of new high yielding cultivars with improved disease tolerance and better quality. He began his career in plant breeding at the age of sixteen as a student assistant in his home town at the University of Kentucky. Thomas earned his B.A. from Michigan State University majoring in humanities, and his graduate degrees from the University of Kentucky majoring in Crop Science, minoring in plant physiology. He completed his education as a post-doctoral researcher at Texas A & M under the supervision of Dr. Bill Rooney. Crops that Thomas has worked with throughout his career include soybean, melon, dry bean, tobacco, bermudagrass, sorghum, pea, lentil, chickpea, and now potato. Thomas enjoys tennis, exercise, reading, and streaming movies and television.

##Husain Agha

Husain is a PhD student in the Applied Plant Sciences program studying plant quantitative and population genetics and is currently investigating the consequences of whole genome duplication. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Classical Humanities at the University of Missouri in 2018. When he is not in the lab, you can find him rock climbing or out on his bicycle!

##Rachel Figueroa

Recently graduated with a B.S. in Environmental Science, Rachel is a part of our team as researcher 1.  She will be researching disease resistance in potatoes through DNA-based markers and managing our growth chambers and greenhouse.  She enjoys exploring the lakes and parks around the Twin Cities, reading, and making jewlery in her spare time.   

##Nicole Mihelich

Nicole is a Ph.D. student and is currently co-advised by Dr. Eric Watkins in Turfgrass Breeding and Genetics and Dr. Laura Shannon in Potato Breeding and Genetics.  She earned a B.S. in Biochemistry with a minor in Environmental Science at University of Wisconsin- Madison.  She then earned her M.S. in Applied Plant Science studying soybean genomic variation.  She is currently researching how to improve fine fescue cool season grass species as a low-input turfgrass, specifically for rhizome production and tillering.  

##Heather Tuttle

Heather is working toward her Master's degree in the Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology program and is currently developing a core germplasm subset for the US potato genebank.  While Heather is not in the lab, she enjoys going on walks around the city lakes, going to concerts, and collecting rocks and minerals.

##Katelyn Filbrandt

As the Lab Manager of Shannon Lab group, Katelyn is currently working on virus eradication using tissue culture to clean up the potato germplasm of 39 varieties from the previous breeding program.  This will allow our breeder to use them in the crossing block and phenotype them in the field to be assessed for release.  She also assists in disease control, genotyping, and field work for the breeding program. Katelyn loves to be out in nature and enjoys outdoor adventure silent sports including ice climbing, mountain biking, and cross country skiing.

###Undergraduates

##Laura Schulz

Laura Schulz is majoring in Plant Science and Bioproducts & Biosystems Engineering. In the Shannon Lab, she is currently working on a UROP related to creating a population of diploid potatoes, and also assists with transplanting, watering, and collecting pollen. In her spare time, Laura enjoys gardening and spending time with her cats.

##John Larsen

John Larsen is majoring in history and plans on going to grad school to get his Ph.D. in modern European History. John's main duties in Shannon Lab include making media, transplanting plants, and doing daily plant maintenance that includes watering and vine killing, as well as tuber harvesting. In his free time, John enjoys listening to music, playing guitar, reading, and preparing presentations to entertain the rest of the lab!

##Sophia Fitzcollins

Sophia Fitcollins is currently an undergraduate student working towards her B.S. in Plant Science with a minor in Architecture.  She assists with greenhouse maintenance as well as mixing media and transplanting.  In her spare time Sophy likes to learn new languages and read books.  

##Thomas McGeehee

Thomas McGehee is an undergraduate student studying Art and Genetics in the College of Biological Sciences. He joined the Shannon Lab this summer as a Field and Lab Assistant. He has really enjoyed watering and caring for the plants and helping out in the field. Although he is unsure where his future will take him, his experiences in the Shannon lab have changed his perspective towards plant breeding and opened his eyes to the many rewarding applications of genetics.
