Dr. Shannon is an assistant professor of potato breeding, genetics, and genomics in the Department of Horticultural Science at the University of Minnesota.  She is a population and quantitative geneticist by training and she applies that experience to elucidate potato diversity and the complex nature of autotetraploid genomics as well as developing new potato varieties for Minnesota growers.  She earned an undergraduate degree in biology and anthropology at Grinnell College and a PhD in genetics from the University of Wisconsin. Her post doctoral research was done in the department of Biomedical Sciences at Cornell and the Department of Horticulture at the University of Wisconsin. She enjoys overly complicated board games, bird watching, and exploring the theater, fashion, and breweries of her new home in the Twin Cities.

Dr. Stefaniak is a Researcher 6, Breeding Specialist in the Department of Horticulture. He is a plant breeder by training focusing on the development of new high yielding cultivars with improved disease tolerance and better quality. Thomas earned his B.A. from Michigan State University majoring in humanities, and his graduate degrees from the University of Kentucky majoring in Crop Science, minoring in plant physiology. He completed his education as a post-doctoral researcher at Texas A & M. Crops that Thomas has worked with throughout his career include soybean, melon, dry bean, tobacco, bermudagrass, sorghum, pea, lentil, chickpea, and now potato. Thomas enjoys tennis, exercise, reading, and streaming movies and television.<br/>

Husain is a PhD student in the Plant & Microbial Biology program studying plant quantitative and population genetics and is currently investigating the consequences of whole genome duplication. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Classical Humanities at the University of Missouri in 2018. When he is not in the lab, you can find him rock climbing or out on his bicycle! Husain is passionate about improving diversity, equity, and inclusion of underrepresented minorities in the sciences, and currently serves as a member of his graduate program's DEI committee.

Megan joined the lab in 2021 as a researcher. Her primary role is in data management, curating the "potatobase" and analyzing the lab's data. She also helps keep things organized as the lab's project manager. Megan is a neophyte to plant breeding, having received her B.A. in Geology from Carleton College where she completed a senior thesis in metamorphic petrology. In her free time, Megan enjoys baking, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, writing, and thrifting. </p>
