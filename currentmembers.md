Dr. Shannon is an assistant professor of potato breeding, genetics, and genomics in the Department of Horticultural Science at the University of Minnesota.  She is a population and quantitative geneticist by training and she applies that experience to elucidate potato diversity and the complex nature of autotetraploid genomics as well as developing new potato varieties for Minnesota growers.  She earned an undergraduate degree in biology and anthropology at Grinnell College and a PhD in genetics from the University of Wisconsin. Her post doctoral research was done in the department of Biomedical Sciences at Cornell and the Department of Horticulture at the University of Wisconsin. She enjoys overly complicated board games, bird watching, and exploring the theater, fashion, and breweries of her new home in the Twin Cities.

Dr. Stefaniak is a Researcher 5, Breeding Specialist 
in the Department of Horticulture. He is a plant 
breeder by training focusing on the development 
of new high yielding cultivars with improved 
disease tolerance and better quality. He began his 
career in plant breeding at the age of sixteen as a 
student assistant in his home town at the 
University of Kentucky. Thomas earned his B.A. 
from Michigan State University majoring in 
humanities, and his graduate degrees from the 
University of Kentucky majoring in Crop Science, 
minoring in plant physiology. He completed his 
education as a post-doctoral researcher at Texas A 
& M under the supervision of Dr. Bill Rooney. 
Crops that Thomas has worked with throughout 
his career include soybean, melon, dry bean, 
tobacco, bermudagrass, sorghum, pea, lentil, 
chickpea, and now potato. Thomas enjoys tennis, 
exercise, reading, and streaming movies and television.<br/>

Nicole is a Ph.D. student and is currently co-advised by [`Dr. Eric Watkins`](https://horticulture.umn.edu/people/faculty/ericwatkins) in [`Turfgrass Breeding and Genetics`](https://turf.umn.edu/) and Dr. Laura Shannon in Potato Breeding and Genetics.  She earned a B.S. in Biochemistry with a minor in Environmental Science at University of Wisconsin- Madison.  She then earned her M.S. in Applied Plant Science studying soybean genomic variation.  She is currently researching how to improve fine fescue cool season grass species as a low-input turfgrass, specifically for rhizome production and tillering.</p>

As the Lab Manager of Shannon Lab group, Katelyn is currently working on virus eradication using tissue culture to clean up the potato germplasm of 39 varieties from the previous breeding program.  This will allow our breeder to use them in the crossing block and phenotype them in the field to be assessed for release.  She also assists in disease control, genotyping, and field work for the breeding program. Katelyn loves to be out in nature and enjoys outdoor adventure silent sports including ice climbing, mountain biking, and cross country skiing.</p>
