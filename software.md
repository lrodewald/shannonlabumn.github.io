### TubAR
TubAR (Tuber Analysis in R) provides potato researchers with a simple means of quantitative phenotyping replacing previously used imprecise qualitative scales. Users collect images of sample tubers using a light box, and then use the package to quantify: tuber length, width, roundness, skinning percentage, redness, and lightness. Finally, the data is prepared for export and use in mapping, genomic selection, etc. The R package is available on [Github]( https://github.com/shannonlabumn/TubAR).
