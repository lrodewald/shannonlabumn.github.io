# The Shannon Lab is hiring!

Join our lab in the Twin Cities! We often have open positions for [graduate students](#graduate-research), [postdocs](#postdoctoral-opportunities), [undergrads](#undergraduate-research), and [researchers](#researchers). Feel free to reach out even if we do not have open opportunities!

### Specific Opportunities

#### Researchers

A full-time, benefitted Researcher 1 position in the Shannon Lab is now open. We are seeking someone with agricultural greenhouse and field research experience to facilitate the pipeline of breeding materials between storage, growth chambers, greenhouses, and field sites. Additionally, this researcher would be responsible for keeping up-to-date inventories of seed and field supplies, and procuring needed materials. This position involves regular field and greenhouse work, as well as overnight travel to field locations.

#### Postdoctoral Opportunities

We are not currently actively looking for postdocs. However, if you're interested in working with us feel free to email Dr. Shannon because we might be able to work something out. Please include a CV and 2 first author manuscripts (pre-prints are fine) in your email.  In general we look for postdocs with computational genetics experience.

#### Undergraduate Research

We regularly hire undergraduates as research assistants in the field and greenhouse. In particular we look for students who are enthusiastic about plant care, don't mind dirt, are willing to lift crates of potatoes, and would like to learn about potato breeding and genetics. 

Interested in summer opportunities? We are looking for undergrad workers to help out in the field, greenhouse, and lab. Part- and full-time opportunities are available. Please contact Megan Harder (harde302@umn.edu) if you're interested.  

We also love to hire students through the [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program](https://ugresearch.umn.edu/opportunities/urop). If you'd like to put together a project related to potato breeding or potato evolution please contact Dr. Shannon introducing yourself and your research interests. We are happy to help you develop your own research project!
