# The Shannon Lab is hiring!

Join our lab in the Twin Cities! We often have open positions for [graduate students](#graduate-research), [postdocs](#postdoctoral-opportunities), [undergrads](#undergraduate-research), and [researchers](#researchers). Feel free to reach out even if we do not have open opportunities!

### Specific Opportunities

#### Postdoctoral Opportunities

We are not currently actively looking for postdocs.  However if you're interested in working with us feel free to email Dr. Shannon because we might be able to work something out. Please include a CV and 2 first author manuscripts (pre-prints are fine) in your email.  In general we look for postdocs with computational genetics experience.

#### Undergraduate Research

We regularly hire undergraduates as research assistants in the field and greenhouse. In particular we look for students who are enthusiastic about plant care, don't mind dirt, are willing to lift crates of potatoes, and would like to learn about potato breeding and genetics. Although we do not have an active listing at the moment please contact Dr. Stefaniak (stefa187@umn.edu) if you're interested.  We also love to hire students through the [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program](https://ugresearch.umn.edu/opportunities/urop). If you'd like to put together a project related to potato breeding or potato evolution please contact Dr. Shannon introducing yourself and your research interests. We are happy to help you develop your own research project!

Looking for a summer research opportunity? The Shannon lab is excited to host a [USDA SOAR-REEU](https://cfans.umn.edu/about/diversity-inclusion/undergrad/SOAR-REEU) intern in the summer of 2023. Applications will continue to be accepted until February 15, 2023.
